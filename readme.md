## What I've done within the scope of the task

I have finished all of the tasks specified in the web and server sections. Only changing the status from IN_DELIVERY has been implemented.

From the perks section, I have addressed points 1 and 5: I have improved the UI and added displaying of additional information about the order. I have also fixed a few minor issues with the code.

# OHM DELIVERY
ohm-delivery is a minimalistic project that you have to improve and build. 

The final customer receive the following trackingId `1e62adfe` by email and a link to the tracking page. 

Improve the website to let the customer search for the status of the resistance. When delivered, the customer can acknowledge the delivery (or the failure) of the ordered resistance. 


## How to use:
In web and server directories, type:
```bash
npm run start
```

To run the tests, go to the server directory and type:
```
npm run test
```

## Instructions:

### Web:
* Build the search to query the ohm informations and display the status to the customer.
* Change the UI to finalize the status of the ohm object.
	* Status can either be 'DELIVERED' or 'REFUSED'.
	* If the status is 'REFUSED', ask the customer to provide a little piece of text as a failure reason.

### Server:
* Create a new endpoint to manage the status transition.
	* Status has to be one of the followings: 
		* `'CREATED' -> 'PREPARING' -> 'READY' -> 'IN_DELIVERY' -> 'DELIVERED'|'REFUSED'`.
	* A given status can only go to the next state, therefore only one transition is possible per status. Only exception is 'IN_DELIVERY', which can go to to either 'DELIVERED' or 'REFUSED'.
* If a failure reason is provided, save it.


### Perks:
1. Show more info about the customer or display the ohm history.
2. Improve existing code and project architecture as you wish.
3. Allow user to quickly re-order a ohm with the same specifications.
4. Allow the user to add a comment about the delivery.
5. Change the UI as you wish.
